      <p>Besides the fact that donuts aren't particularly good for you, they are good for your soul. Tell me about a time
        someone offered you a donut and you said no? Yeah, that's what I thought. How many times have you woken up and
        craved a donut? Too many, honestly. Here's some logic behind why you can't say no to these little pieces of
        heaven:</p>
      <ol class="has-text-justified">
        <li>1. You can eat them for breakfast and dessert (or really any time)! If that isn't the coolest thing ever, then I'm not sure about most things in life.</li>
        <li>2. You can get them for pretty cheap. Most donuts are maybe fifty cents or a dollar, maybe a couple dollars max. Sugary treats for a good price? I'll take 10!!!</li>
        <li>3. Buying coffee is a good excuse for adding a donut to your order. "I'll take a caramel mocha, and you can throw in a chocolate donut too, actually." It's so easy.</li>
        <li>4. They are very accessible. There are so many places you can find a donut. Gas stations, grocery stores, coffee shops, donut shops, probably in your office at work, in your kitchen... Endless options, really.</li>
        <li>5. They are a great conversation starter. "Oh you like pink frosting with sprinkles too? Omg, let's be friends!" Don't act like this has never happened to you.</li>
