      <p>Besides the fact that donuts aren't particularly good for you, they are good for your soul. Tell me about a time
        someone offered you a donut and you said no? Yeah, that's what I thought. How many times have you woken up and
        craved a donut? Too many, honestly. Here's some logic behind why you can't say no to these little pieces of
        heaven:</p>
      <ol class="has-text-justified">
        <li>You can eat them for breakfast and dessert (or really any time)! If that isn't the coolest thing ever, then I'm not sure about most things in life.</li>
        <li>You can get them for pretty cheap. Most donuts are maybe fifty cents or a dollar, maybe a couple dollars max. Sugary treats for a good price? I'll take 10!!!</li>
        <li>Buying coffee is a good excuse for adding a donut to your order. "I'll take a caramel mocha, and you can throw in a chocolate donut too, actually." It's so easy.</li>
        <li>They are very accessible. There are so many places you can find a donut. Gas stations, grocery stores, coffee shops, donut shops, probably in your office at work, in your kitchen... Endless options, really.</li>
        <li>They are a great conversation starter. "Oh you like pink frosting with sprinkles too? Omg, let's be friends!" Don't act like this has never happened to you.</li>
        <li>Like surprises? You can get filled donuts! For the adventurous type, you can buy donuts that have yummy cream or jelly filling inside, as if the dough wasn't already on point!</li>
        <li>There is no such thing as a bad donut. It's like pizza. Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.</li>
